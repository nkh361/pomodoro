# TQDM Pomodoro

This is a very basic Pomodoro script for a minimal CLI timer.

# Preperation and usage

After cloning the repo, I suggest creating a bash/zsh/etc. alias for easy calling. To create an alias:

'''bash
alias _alias_name_="python3 ~/file/location"
'''

Be mindful not to add spaces before and after the equal sign.

Then to use the timer, simply call on the command line,

'''bash
_alias_name_
'''
